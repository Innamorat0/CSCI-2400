1) show buffer in gebuff - dissas in gdb/objdump
2) how to get rsp address - look at rsp using 'ir %rsp' right after getbuff allocation
3) how to write assembley instructions - 'gcc -c assem.s, objdump -d assem.o' to get hex or look in pdf
4) show where gadgets are - objdump then go to start-farm, find hex address
